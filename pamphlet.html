	<h3>
    The Company:
    </h3>
    <img alt ="the modern garden logo of a beet" class ="gardenlogo" src="https://cdn.glitch.global/a0ddd621-92ef-428e-89cb-b4cc488ab179/Logo_the_Modern_Garden.png?v=1687291873160">
    <p>
      The Modern Garden is a non-profit organization based in the U.S. that provides education and services relating to permaculture and permaculture installations. Its main goal is to garner national interest through the distribution of highly curated, well-designed, informative, and approachable media. 
    </p>
	
    
    <h3>
      The Subject:
    </h3>
    <p>An educational pamphlet on the topic of Layered Gardening as it relates to permaculture. Details on the necessary layers of a garden to create a self-sustaining ecosystem that supports wild-life, pollinators, and human crops.</p>
    
<h3>
  
  My Role:
    </h3>	<p>
    An independent designer with complete autonomy of the project from start to finish, provided the project requirements are met.
    </p>
	

	
	<h3>
    Initial Design Process:
    </h3>
		<ol>
      
  <li> Create mood boards which define and apply company values to a design language.</li> 
      <p>
        This mood board was created with the idea of "calm elegance" in mind. This is a concept that has mass appeal and is appropriate for educational services. Fonts were chosen to be professional with a touch of playfulness to create a welcoming atmosphere. The color choices were picked from an analogous palette to support calmness. Warm blues, greens, and purples allude to the earth and gardening.
      </p>

		<li>Brainstorm using thumbnails and ideations to choose a suitable design direction.</li> 
      <p>
        After numerous iterations, a simple beet logo with text following the outline was choses as the most appropriate and memorable. As for the layout, a tri-fold design was chosen for it's usefulness and familiarity to the general public. To create interest, a modern suburban home behind layers of garden was designed.
      </p>
		<li> Complete draft with print mockup.</li>

    </ol><h3>
     Challenges: 
    </h3><p>
    
    I experienced challenges with creating a dye-cut and layout for a multi-fold document that is unique in each page, yet coherent in all manners of opening and folding. To ensure the move from a flat surface to the folded 2.5-D form was seamless, each design iteration was printed, cut, and folded to check for abberations.</p>

    <h4>
      Obtaining Feedback
    </h4>
		<p> After giving a formal presentation on the project, the following feedback was given by peers and instructors:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The house and fence design was overly refined making it difficult to identify.</li>
        <li>Lack of specific illustrations for each text box reduced learning interest.</li>
    </ol> 
    
    <h4>
      Changes
    </h4>
    
    	<p> After reviewing the feedback, the following revisions were made:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Added detail to the house and fence including trim and textures.</li>
        <li>Created specific illustrations for each text box</li>
    </ol> 
<h3>
  Final Result
    </h3>
    <p>
      This is still a work in progress.
