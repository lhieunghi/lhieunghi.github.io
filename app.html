  My Role:
    </h3>	<p>
    An independent designer with complete autonomy of the project from start to finish, provided the project requirements are met.
    </p>
	
	
	<h3>
    Process:
    </h3>
		<ol>
      
  <li> Create mood boards which define and apply values to a design language.</li> 
      
      <p>
        Inspiration was drawn from various food related mobile games. A vibrant and warm toned color scheme was selected to relate to food, satiety, and gaming. 
      </p>

		<li>Brainstorm using thumbnails and ideations to choose a suitable design direction.</li> 
		<p>
      After numerous sketches and concept exploration, a simple text logo was chosen for the high readability and to highlight the fun name of the application. The font was chosen because of it's round and sharp edges which showcased the cute and edgy meaning of the phrase. The layout was carefully designed to fit all necessary features in an easy to use, visually appeaing, and logical manner.
      </p>
		<li> Complete clickable prototype.</li>

    </ol><h3>
     Challenges: 
    </h3><p>
    
    It was challenging to create an easy to use and fun application that is also able to organize vasts amounts of recipe information. I simplified the interface as much as possible by breaking the main pages into the categories "shopping" "recipes" and "sale". Then created many subsections within each category that was able cover all the necessary functionality while maintaining user flow with a simple interface. </p>
    
    <p>
     Secondly, it was a challenge to balance the vibrant color scheme with a need for potentially prolonged use. To fix this, I chose a complementary color scheme with bright, but toned down saturation. This allowed the the interface to be bright and fun, while also creating a calm enough palette for prolonged use.

      Getting Feedback
    </h4>
		<p> After giving a formal presentation on the project, the following feedback was given:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The home icon moving is distracting from the page content.</li>
        <li>Orginal and discounted prices would be more useful than the discount percentage.</li>
        <li>Unclear what the add button does.</li>
    </ol> 
    
    <h4>
      Changes
    </h4>
    
    	<p> After reviewing the feedback, the following revisions were made:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Icon movement was removed.</li>
        <li>Replaced percentage with prices</li>
        <li>Added feedback in the form of a description after add button is selected so user can identify what happened.</li>
    </ol>
